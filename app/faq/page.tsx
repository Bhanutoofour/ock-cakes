      },
      {
        question: "Will my customized cake look exactly like the reference image?",
        answer:
          "Because every cake is handcrafted, the final design may vary slightly from the reference image. We always aim for a close match, but exact replication is not guaranteed, especially for highly detailed or premium reference designs.",

      {
        question: "Are OccasionKart cakes freshly baked?",

        question: "Do you accept returns for cakes and desserts?",
        answer:
          "No. Since cakes and desserts are perishable and made to order, returns are not accepted after delivery. If there is a verified issue such as damage, spoilage, or incorrect delivery, please contact us within 2 hours with photo or video proof.",
      },
      {
        question: "When do I get a refund for a cake order?",
